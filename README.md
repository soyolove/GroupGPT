# Quick start

GroupGPT can run without back-end (like python implementation of agent) because it has a light-weight agent frame inside.

To quick start with full experience and function, what you need to do is to set .env file.

1. create .env file in 'group-gpt-app' according to .env.example format

2. get your supabase key and openai api-key 

3. fill them to .env file

4. run 'cd group-gpt-app' in terminal/cmd to enter the app folder

5. run 'npm install' to install all dependencies

6. run 'npm run dev' to start the app

7. Generally, the app will be running on http://localhost:3000 , or you can see the url in terminal/cmd log
